**What are we doing here**

	This is NOT a “video game.” This will NEVER be sold or published.
	This is to be a sandbox of fun and/or stupid ideas to mess around and have a good time with. 
 	It is okay to just straight-up rip off things we think are fun. No one cares about balance.

**What we want to make**

	Basically, the idea is that this will evolve over time into a platform for us to add stuff to and just have a good time. 
 	We’ll basically use it as a way cooler DnD. 

**Main idea:**

	Gameplay of Anthem
	Visual style of Marathon
	Map and world of BoTW and ToTK
	Little bit of Halo and Destiny vibe sprinkled in
	
**Phase 1:**

	Phase 1 (MCU reference) will focus on building a VERY VERY BASIC gameplay system; 
 	basically just get the movement and shooting down in the most basic form. 
  	These systems will all be part of phase 1:
		Basic on-foot movement (walk, run, jump)
		Basic advanced movement 
  			(simple flying, grapple, thrusting), leave limitations out for now to keep things simple (no jetpack overheat)
		Basic weapon types (most ranged and melee in simplest form)
		Reloading/recharging weapons
